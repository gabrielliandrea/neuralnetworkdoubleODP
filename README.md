# A Neural Network Boosted Double Over-Dispersed Poisson Claims Reserving Model
The purpose of this project is to present a claims reserving technique that takes into account both claim counts and claim amounts. The main reason for considering such a joint model is that adding claim counts information should improve the prediction of future claim amounts. We start with defining two separate ccODP models for the claim counts and the claim amounts. Then, we jointly embed the two separate ccODP models into a neural network architecture. This neural network will have a two-dimensional output vector, as we need to simultaneously model future claim counts and future claim amounts. As starting point of the neural network calibration we use exactly the two separate ccODP models. Training of the neural network then allows us for joint modeling and mutual learning of the claim counts and the claim amounts beyond the two individual ccODP models.

In this project we work with a synthetic insurance dataset generated by an [individual claims history simulation machine](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/6/2/29) of [6]. This synthetic dataset consists of individual claims from six lines of business for which we have complete information. We remark that having complete information is crucial for this project, as it allows us to back-test the newly developed claims reserving models.

The relevant R code for applying the neural network boosted double over-dispersed Poisson claims reserving model is provided in the zip file [ANeuralNetworkBoostedDoubleOverDispersedPoissonModelGithub.zip](https://github.com/gabrielliandrea/neuralnetworkdoubleODP/blob/master/ANeuralNetworkBoostedDoubleOverDispersedPoissonModelGithub.zip). On the one hand, in the file `SingleNNDODPModel.r` we consider a separate neural network embedding for every line of business. On the other hand, in the file `MultipleNNDODPModel.r` we model all the lines of business simultaneously. Such a model allows us to learn additional information across the different lines of business. The folder `SimulationMachine` contains the individual claims history simulation machine needed for generating the data. The two folders `SingleNNDODPModelWeights` and `MultipleNNDODPModelWeights` are used to store the resulting fitted neural network weights. For the theoretical details we refer to the corresponding [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3365517).
